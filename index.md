<!--## Welcome to GitHub Pages-->

As of December 2021 I am an EPSRC research associate in the School of Mathematics, University of Leeds. 
Before that I was a PhD student supervised by [Professor Paul Martin](http://www1.maths.leeds.ac.uk/~ppmartin/research.html) and [Dr. Jo&atilde;o Faria Martins](http://www1.maths.leeds.ac.uk/~pmtjfa/) also at the University of Leeds. I defended my thesis 'Embedded cobordisms, motion groupoids and topological quantum field theories' in December 2021.

## Research

I am interested in a variety of areas where topology, algebra, representation theory and category theory arise in mathematical physics.

Some keywords: topological quantum computation, topological quantum field theory, modular tensor categories, statistical mechanics, motion groupoids, mapping class groupoids

## CV

My CV can be found <a href="CV/CV_FTorzewska.pdf" target="_blank">here.</a>
